      <h1>SERENITY</h1>
      Calmness of mind is one of the beautiful jewels of wisdom. It is the
      result of long and patient effort in self-control. Its presence is an
      indication of ripened experience, and of a more than ordinary knowledge of
      the laws and operations of thought.
      <hr />
      A man becomes calm in the measure that he understands himself as the
      thought-evolved being, for such knowledge necessitates the understanding
      of others as the result of thought, and as he develops a right
      understanding, and sees more and more clearly the internal relations of
      things by the action of cause and effect, he ceases to fuss fume and worry
      and grieve, and remains poised, steadfast, serene.
      <hr />
      The calm man, having learned how to govern himself, know how to adapt
      himself to others; and they, in turn, reverence his spiritual strength,
      and feel that they can learn from him and rely upon him. The more tranquil
      a man becomes, the greater is his success, his influence, his power for
      good. Even the ordinary trader will find his business prosperity increase
      as he develops a greater self-control and equanimity, for people will
      always prefer to deal with a man whose demeanor is equitable.
      <hr />
      The strong, calm man is always loved and revered. He is like a
      shade-giving tree in a thirsty land, or a sheltering rock in a storm. “Who
      does not love a tranquil heart? A sweet-tempered, balanced life? It does
      not matter whether it rains or shines, or what changes come to those
      possessing these blessings, for they are always sweet, serene, and calm.
      That exquisite poise of character which we call serenity is the last
      lesson of culture; it is the flowering of life, the fruitage of the soul.
      It is precious as wisdom, more to be desired than gold- yea, than even
      fine gold. How insignificant mere money-seeking looks in comparison with a
      serene life- a life that dwells in the ocean of Truth, beneath the waves,
      beyond the reach of the tempests, in the Eternal Calm!
      <hr />
      How many people we know who sour their lives, who ruin all that is sweet
      and beautiful by explosive tempers, who destroy their poise of character,
      and make bad blood! It is a question whether the great majority of people
      do not ruin their lives and mar their happiness by lack of self-control.
      How few people we meet in life who are well balanced, who have that
      exquisite poise which is characteristic of the finished character.
      <hr />
      Yes, humanity surges with uncontrolled passion, is tumultuous with
      ungoverned grief, is blown about by anxiety and doubt. Only the wise man,
      only he whose thoughts are controlled and purified, makes the winds in the
      storms of the soul obey him.
      <hr />
      Tempest-tossed souls, wherever you may be, under whatsoever conditions ye
      may live, know this – in the ocean of life the isles of Blessedness are
      smiling, and the sunny shore of your ideal awaits your coming. Keep your
      hands firmly upon the helm of thought. In the barque of your soul reclined
      the commanding Master; He does but sleep; wake Him! Self-control is
      strength; Right thought is mastery; Calmness is power. Say unto your
      heart, “Peace, Be Still.”
